## About The Project

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that offers both single-player and local multiplayer experiences. Challenge yourself against the Minimax algorithm or enjoy friendly matches with a friend on the same device. With the convenience of localStorage, you can always pick up where you left off, ensuring uninterrupted gameplay even if the session is closed before completion.
